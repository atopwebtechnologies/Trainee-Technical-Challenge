# Remote Trainee Technical Challenge at Atop Web Technologies

## 🚀 Live Coding Session Overview
Welcome to Atop Web Technologies' live coding session! Today, you'll demonstrate your technical skills (frontend/backend) by building a sleek UI based on the design inspiration we've shared or a simple CRUD application. Let's create something amazing together!


# Frontend Path

## 🛠️ What We're Building
You'll craft a user interface in React that encompasses the key elements of our chosen design. Focus on front-end and visual fidelity—no backend required for now.

## 📝 Session Guidelines
- Write clean, well-organized code, reflecting React best practices.
- Engage with us throughout the session—ask questions, think aloud, and share your reasoning.
- Emphasize UI components (for frontend), and don't worry about the actual data — mock data will suffice.

## 🕗 During the Session
- We'll start with a quick overview of the design and the specific elements you'll focus on.
- You'll code in real-time, sharing your screen as you bring the UI to life.
- Interaction is key! Discuss your approach and feel free to engage us in your process.

## 🔍 Post-Challenge Review
After the session, we'll take a moment to review your work together. We'll chat about the choices you made and any hurdles you may have faced.

We're thrilled to see your creativity in action. Good luck, and let's get started! 💪🎉

# Backend Path

## 🛠️ What We're Building
Build a simple CRUD application for a book store where users can retrieve all metadata, filter book metadata by authorId, retieve a book metadata by authorId, add a new Item, update existing item by authorId and delete a book metadata.

Here is the provided mock data to work with: 

```js
const books = [
    { authorId: "WS", author: "William Shakespeare", title: "Romeo and Juliet" },
    { authorId: "JA", author: "Jane Austen", title: "Pride and Prejudice" },
    { authorId: "FD", author: "Fyodor Dostoevsky", title: "Crime and Punishment" },
    { authorId: "GGM", author: "Gabriel Garcia Marquez", title: "One Hundred Years of Solitude" },
    { authorId: "HM", author: "Haruki Murakami", title: "Norwegian Wood" }
];
``` 
**Note**: There is no need of using a real database. Implement this with the provided array acting as an In-memory db. Your correctness should be validated via a simple console.log and/or your response body.

## ✅ Challenge Requirements
- **API Endpoints**: Build out the neccessary endpoints required to acoomplish the task.

## 📝 Session Guidelines
